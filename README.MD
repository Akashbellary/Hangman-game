# About the project

This is a project inspired by the childrens word guessing game, "The Hangman".
You have to guess a Word based on the number of digits specified. You have 5 chances to select the right characters. If you fail to guess the word right, the man will be hanged (Not the real man, don't worry).

## How to run the project ?

Assuming you have `node` installed.

- Install dependencies with `npm install`
- Run locally with `npm run dev`
- Build for production with `npm run build` and a dist folder should appear

Enjoy guessing the right words...
